Overview
========

* To use Locator, add your locations to the storeLocations array. The only requirement is that the last five characters of each array member must end in a five-digit zipcode. 
* By default, Locator matches the first three characters of the user-supplied zipcode. If you'd prefer an exact match, there's a section of code you can uncomment (and comment out the fuzzy match).
